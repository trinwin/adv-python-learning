An ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel
infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first confirmed to have spread to Italy
on 31 January 2020, when two Chinese tourists in Rome tested positive
for the virus.[2] One week later an Italian man repatriated back to
Italy from the city of Wuhan, China, was hospitalised and confirmed as
the third case in Italy.[3] A cluster of cases was later detected,
starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February,[4] and 60
additional cases and the first deaths on 22 February.[5] By the
beginning of March, the virus had spread to all regions of Italy.[6]
